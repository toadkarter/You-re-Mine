# You're Mine
![](./ReadmeImages/youremine.JPG)

"You're Mine" is a short prototype platformer made during the "New Devs Game Jam".

The prompt / theme for the game jam was "DEATH = PROGRESS". 

The game was built in the Unity game engine and can be played at my itch.io link below. The link also contains information in relation to how to play the game and credits for the game assets.
